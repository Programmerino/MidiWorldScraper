# MidiWorldScraper
## Scrapes every available song on MidiWorld

## Dependencies
* Google Go (```sudo apt install golang-go```)
* grab (```go get -u github.com/cavaliercoder/grab```)

## Disclaimer
This shouldn't be used in any important projects as MidiWorld could simply change how their website downloads files, which would break my application. By using the software, you are responsible for everything the application does. Because of this, I recommend you read the code to make sure you understand what the application is doing.
